Reflection : 
This project was meant for us to use what we learned about CSS and HTML and apply it by picking a website to mimic or "copycat". Throughout this project I got to actually experience what it would be like to make a simple website which will help me in the near future when it comes to the freedom project. I have learned to try and conserve my time since I kind of did this last minute. I pushed it back and I will try to not do this with any of my future projects because it was not a great experience. Other than that this project was a great use of time and energy. It taught me valuable lessons and gave me and idea on what it would be like to code my own website.
